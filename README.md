# windows-toolkit
Bunch of handy tools written in python for Windows

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automate instalation of [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) - package manager for Windows and packages provided by this manager. Program will display menu, where you can check, which program you want to install.

Idea for this project is to simplify process of installation of tools that you need on your computer. Instead of wasting half of your day on downloading instalation files, clicking "next, next , next", you can define your own list of programs to install, hit enter and come back later, when everything is installed.
